### Hand-ins and grading

Your final individual grade is determined from a cumulative evaluation of a small individual written quiz
in Week 13 and your individual contributions to the final programming project. To submit a final programming project,
you must have submitted and passed the CodeCamp project earlier in the semester.

Both the CodeCamp project and the final project are "handed in" as collaborative GitHub repositories. Both
projects should be completed in small groups (2 to 3 people). Exceptions to work alone on the final
project may be granted on request. More details on the projects and requirements for passing will
be pushed in the coming weeks.
