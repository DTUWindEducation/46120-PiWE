## Solo teams

This class focuses on collaborative code development, so working in a team is the default.
However, in some cases, we may grant exceptions for people working in solo teams. E.g.,
students working on research projects who have a particular use for their code.

To petition to work as a solo team, send an email Jenni by midnight on Sunday, Mar. 30
that explains your reason for working solo. Decisions on your petition will be made Mar. 31.
If your petition is denied, you will be required to work in a team, so procrastination is 
not advised. NOTE: If granted permission to work solo, you are still expected to use feature
branches and PRs.
