# PiWE Week 13: Final quiz and final project presentations

* **Office hours:** None! The course is done after this week. :')
* **Slides**: to be uploaded.


## Final project requirements and rubric

See PDF in the same folder as this README.
Repos lock **Sunday May 4 at 23:59**.

## Feedback forms due before class

Your team must submit the feedback forms for 3 other teams by **May 7, 23:59**.

In this subfolder, there is an Excel form to help you collate your feedback. The
Excel sheet also contains the functional requirements for the different projects
in the other tabs.

The link to the Microsoft form you need to submit is on Learn / 
Administration.
**When submitting, please remember**:  
 * Be careful when selecting who you are and who you're evaluating.  
 * Check "send me an email receipt of my responses" before submission.
 * Click "Save my response to edit" after submission in case you made a mistake.

## Who you should submit feedback for

The course evaluation results showed that students did not find it
beneficial to give feedback to teams who did different projects, so
we have split according to project. The diagram below shows who reviews
whom and which BOR you should enter during class.

* If you are in a BOR with 3 teams total:  
  * Review the 2 other teams in your BOR PLUS the 1 team listed in "Review 3"
    column.  
  * E.g., Soul Finders reviews Breeze-Tech, Lightning McTeam, and La Bombas
    del Diablo.  
* If you are in a BOR with 4 teams total and Review 1/Review 2 is empty:  
  * Review the 3 other teams in your BOR.  
  * E.g., Stop Fucking Spiders reviews WindWizards, codingteam and Crypto-Mania.  
* If you are in a BOR with 4 teams total and Review 1/Review 2 is NOT empty:  
  * Review the 3 teams listed in the "Review" columns.  
  * E.g., Los Programadores reviews WindGPT, WindFusion and FatalError.
